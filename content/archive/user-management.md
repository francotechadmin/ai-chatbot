# User Management & Team Collaboration

Effective user management is crucial for maintaining security, productivity, and collaboration within your AI chatbot platform. This comprehensive guide covers user roles, permissions, team management, and collaboration features.

## Understanding User Roles and Permissions

### Role Hierarchy

The platform implements a three-tier role-based access control (RBAC) system:

#### **Superuser**
- **Full system access** - Complete administrative control
- **User management** - Create, modify, and delete all user accounts
- **System configuration** - Access to all platform settings and configurations
- **Data management** - Full access to all conversations, knowledge base, and analytics
- **Integration management** - Configure and manage all external integrations
- **Billing and subscription** - Manage platform subscriptions and usage limits

#### **Admin**
- **Organization management** - Manage users within their organization
- **Content oversight** - Review and approve knowledge base content
- **Analytics access** - View organization-wide usage and performance metrics
- **Integration configuration** - Set up and manage approved integrations
- **Policy enforcement** - Implement and monitor compliance policies
- **Limited system settings** - Access to organization-specific configurations

#### **User**
- **Chat access** - Create and manage personal conversations
- **Knowledge base usage** - Search and reference approved organizational content
- **File uploads** - Upload documents for personal use and analysis
- **Basic analytics** - View personal usage statistics and conversation history
- **Profile management** - Update personal settings and preferences

### Permission Matrix

## Adding and Managing Team Members

### User Creation Process

#### For Superusers and Admins

1. **Navigate to User Management**
   ```
   Dashboard → Administration → User Management
   ```

2. **Click "Add New User"**
   - Enter user details (name, email, initial role)
   - Set temporary password or enable email invitation
   - Assign to appropriate organization (Superuser only)
   - Configure initial permissions and restrictions

3. **Send Invitation**
   - System generates secure invitation link
   - Email sent with onboarding instructions
   - Temporary access credentials provided
   - First-login password reset required

#### Bulk User Import

For large teams, use the bulk import feature:

1. **Download the user template**
   ```csv
   email,first_name,last_name,role,organization,department
   john.doe@company.com,John,Doe,user,main,engineering
   jane.smith@company.com,Jane,Smith,admin,main,operations
   ```

2. **Upload the CSV file**
   - Validate data format and required fields
   - Review import preview before confirmation
   - System processes and sends invitations automatically

3. **Monitor import status**
   - Track successful account creations
   - Review any failed imports with error details
   - Resend invitations for failed entries

### User Account Management

#### Modifying User Accounts

**Changing User Roles:**
1. Select user from the user management dashboard
2. Click "Edit User" or use the role dropdown
3. Select new role from available options
4. Confirm role change and notify user
5. Changes take effect immediately

**Updating User Information:**
- **Personal details** - Name, email, department
- **Contact information** - Phone, location, timezone
- **Preferences** - Default language, notification settings
- **Access restrictions** - IP limitations, time-based access

#### Account Status Management

**Active Status:**
- Full access to assigned features and permissions
- Can create new conversations and access knowledge base
- Receives notifications and system updates

**Suspended Status:**
- Temporary access restriction
- Retains data but cannot log in
- Can be reactivated without data loss
- Useful for temporary leave or security concerns

**Deactivated Status:**
- Permanent account closure
- Data archived according to retention policies
- Cannot be reactivated (new account required)
- Used for permanent departures

## Role Assignment and Access Control

### Dynamic Role Assignment

#### Project-Based Roles

Assign temporary elevated permissions for specific projects:

1. **Create project workspace**
   - Define project scope and duration
   - Set specific permissions required
   - Assign team members with temporary roles

2. **Manage project access**
   - Grant additional permissions for project duration
   - Monitor project-specific activity
   - Automatically revoke permissions when project ends

#### Conditional Access Policies

Set up automated access control based on conditions:

**Time-Based Access:**
```yaml
policy_name: "Business Hours Only"
conditions:
  - time_range: "09:00-17:00"
  - days: ["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday"]
  - timezone: "UTC-5"
actions:
  - allow_chat_access: true
  - allow_knowledge_base: true
```

**Location-Based Access:**
```yaml
policy_name: "Office Network Only"
conditions:
  - ip_ranges: ["192.168.1.0/24", "10.0.0.0/8"]
  - countries: ["US", "CA"]
actions:
  - allow_sensitive_data: true
  - require_2fa: false
```

**Device-Based Access:**
```yaml
policy_name: "Managed Devices"
conditions:
  - device_compliance: true
  - os_versions: ["Windows 10+", "macOS 12+", "iOS 15+"]
actions:
  - allow_file_download: true
  - allow_offline_access: true
```

### Permission Inheritance

#### Organization Hierarchy

Permissions flow down through organizational structure:

```
Organization (Global Policies)
├── Department (Department-Specific Rules)
│   ├── Team (Team-Specific Access)
│   │   └── Individual (Personal Overrides)
```

#### Permission Conflicts Resolution

When multiple policies apply, the system follows this precedence:

1. **Explicit Deny** - Always takes precedence
2. **Explicit Allow** - Overrides inherited permissions
3. **Inherited Permissions** - From parent organizational units
4. **Default Deny** - If no explicit permissions exist

## User Status Management and Activity Tracking

### Real-Time Activity Monitoring

#### Active Session Tracking

Monitor current user activity:

- **Online status** - Real-time presence indicators
- **Current activity** - Active conversations, knowledge base searches
- **Session duration** - Time spent in current session

#### Activity Dashboard
