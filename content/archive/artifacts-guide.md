# Artifacts: Interactive Content Creation

Artifacts are one of the most powerful features of your AI chatbot platform, enabling you to create, edit, and collaborate on interactive content in real-time. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about working with artifacts.

## What are Artifacts and When They're Created

### Understanding Artifacts

Artifacts are interactive, editable content pieces that the AI creates during your conversations. Unlike regular chat responses, artifacts provide:

- **Live editing capabilities** - Modify content directly in the interface
- **Real-time updates** - See changes immediately as you work
- **Version tracking** - Keep history of all modifications
- **Export options** - Save or share your work in various formats
- **Collaborative features** - Work together with team members

### When Artifacts are Created

The AI automatically creates artifacts when you request:

#### **Content Creation Tasks**
- **"Create a document about..."** - Generates text artifacts
- **"Write code for..."** - Creates code editor artifacts
- **"Make a spreadsheet with..."** - Builds interactive spreadsheets
- **"Design an image of..."** - Creates image editing artifacts

#### **Substantial Content**
Artifacts are created for content that is:
- **Self-contained** - Complete documents, scripts, or designs
- **Reusable** - Content you might want to modify or reference later
- **Substantial** - More than just a quick answer or explanation
- **Interactive** - Content that benefits from direct editing

> [!NOTE]
> The AI decides when to create artifacts based on the nature and scope of your request. You can also explicitly ask for content to be created as an artifact.
