# Advanced Query Techniques

Master the art of finding information quickly and accurately with our advanced search capabilities. This guide covers powerful search operators, filters, and techniques to help you locate exactly what you need.

## Search Fundamentals

### Basic Search Syntax

Our search engine supports several types of queries:

```
Simple search: knowledge management
Phrase search: "knowledge management system"
Wildcard search: manag* (finds manage, management, manager, etc.)
```

### Boolean Operators

Combine terms using logical operators:

- **AND**: `knowledge AND management` (both terms must be present)
- **OR**: `documentation OR guide` (either term can be present)
- **NOT**: `search NOT basic` (exclude the second term)

> [!TIP]
> Use parentheses to group complex queries: `(knowledge OR information) AND (management OR system)`

## Advanced Search Operators

### Field-Specific Searches

Target specific fields in your search:

| Operator | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `title:` | `title:getting started` | Search only in titles |
| `author:` | `author:"John Doe"` | Find content by specific author |
| `category:` | `category:basics` | Filter by category |
| `tag:` | `tag:tutorial` | Search by tags |

### Date and Time Filters

Find content based on when it was created or modified:

```
created:2024-01-01..2024-12-31
modified:>2024-06-01
published:<2024-03-15
```

### Content Type Filters

Search within specific content types:

- `type:document` - Text documents
- `type:video` - Video content
- `type:image` - Images and diagrams
- `type:link` - External links

## Search Filters and Facets

### Using the Filter Panel

The search interface provides several filter options:

1. **Content Type**: Filter by document, video, image, etc.
2. **Category**: Narrow results by topic area
3. **Author**: Find content from specific contributors
4. **Date Range**: Limit results to specific time periods
5. **Tags**: Filter by associated keywords

### Combining Filters

Filters work together to narrow your results:

> [!WARNING]
> Too many filters can sometimes exclude relevant results. Start broad and narrow down gradually.

## Search Strategies

### The Funnel Approach

1. **Start Broad**: Begin with general terms
2. **Add Specificity**: Include more specific keywords
3. **Apply Filters**: Use categories and date ranges
4. **Refine Results**: Adjust based on what you find

### Synonym and Related Term Searching

If your initial search doesn't yield results, try:

- **Synonyms**: "guide" instead of "tutorial"
- **Related terms**: "documentation" for "manual"
- **Different perspectives**: "troubleshooting" vs "problem solving"

## Advanced Techniques

### Proximity Searches

Find terms that appear near each other:

```
"knowledge management" NEAR/5 "best practices"
```

This finds documents where "knowledge management" appears within 5 words of "best practices".

### Fuzzy Matching

Handle typos and variations:

```
managment~ (finds "management" despite the typo)
color~1 (finds "colour" with 1 character difference)
```

### Regular Expressions

For power users, use regex patterns:

```
/^[Kk]nowledge.*[Mm]anagement$/
```

> [!NOTE]
> Regular expressions require the "Advanced Mode" to be enabled in search settings.

## Search Results Optimization

### Understanding Result Ranking

Results are ranked based on:

1. **Relevance Score**: How well content matches your query
2. **Recency**: Newer content may rank higher
3. **Authority**: Content from trusted sources
4. **User Engagement**: Frequently accessed content

### Improving Search Results

To get better results:

- **Use specific terms** rather than generic ones
- **Include context** in your queries
- **Try different phrasings** of the same concept
- **Use quotes** for exact phrases

## Saved Searches and Alerts

### Creating Saved Searches

Save frequently used queries:

1. Perform your search
2. Click "Save Search" in the results
3. Name your search and set preferences
4. Access from "My Searches" menu

### Setting Up Alerts

Get notified when new content matches your criteria:

```javascript
// Example alert configuration
{
  "query": "category:updates AND tag:security",
  "frequency": "daily",
  "delivery": "email"
}
```

## Search Analytics

### Understanding Your Search Patterns

The system tracks:

- **Most frequent queries**
- **Search success rates**
- **Time spent on results**
- **Popular content**

### Improving Team Search Habits

Use analytics to:

1. Identify knowledge gaps
2. Improve content organization
3. Train team members on better search techniques
4. Create targeted content for common queries

## Troubleshooting Search Issues

### Common Problems and Solutions

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| No results | Too specific query | Remove some terms or filters |
| Too many results | Too broad query | Add more specific terms |
| Irrelevant results | Ambiguous terms | Use quotes for exact phrases |
| Missing expected content | Content not indexed | Check if content is published |
