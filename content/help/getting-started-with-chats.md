# Getting Started with Chats

Welcome to our AI-powered knowledge management system! This guide will help you understand how to interact with the application to access information, capture knowledge, and get answers to your questions.

## What is This Application?

This application combines AI chat capabilities with knowledge management to help you:

- **Access** documentation and information during chat sessions
- **Capture** tacit knowledge through guided conversations
- **Query** your knowledge base to find relevant information
- **Organize** information for easy retrieval when needed

## How to Use This Application

### Step 1: Browsing the Knowledge Base

Before starting a chat session, you may want to explore what documentation is already available:

1. Navigate to the **Knowledge Base** section using the sidebar
2. Browse through categories or use the search bar to find specific topics
3. Review available documents to understand what information is accessible
4. Note important documents you might want to reference during chats

> [!TIP]
> Familiarize yourself with the existing knowledge base before starting chat sessions.

### Step 2: Chatting with Knowledge Context

To have a chat session with access to your knowledge base:

1. Go to the **Chat** section in the navigation sidebar
2. Begin your conversation with clear questions or statements
3. The AI will automatically reference relevant information from your knowledge base
4. You can explicitly ask for specific documents by saying "Please check the documentation on [topic]"

Example conversation:
```
You: What's our current process for onboarding?
AI: Based on the documentation in the knowledge base, the onboarding process involves 5 steps...
```

### Step 3: Capturing Tacit Knowledge

To document new information through conversation:

1. Start a chat session as described above
2. Tell the AI you want to capture knowledge by saying something like:
   - "I'd like to document our new x, y and z process"
   - "Let's create documentation about x, y, and, z process"
3. The AI will guide you through a series of questions to extract the information
4. Review the generated document for accuracy
5. Ask the AI to upload the document to knowledge base
6. Once approved, the document will be integrated into the knowledge base and available for everyone

Example conversation:
```
You: I want to document our new customer support workflow
AI: Great! I'll help you create documentation for your customer support workflow. 
    Let's start with the basics. What are the main stages in the workflow?
You: First contact, issue identification, resolution, and follow-up
AI: [Continues asking relevant questions to build the document]
```

### Step 4: Querying the Knowledge Base

To get answers based on your knowledge base:

1. In any chat session, ask specific questions about information that might be in your knowledge base
2. The AI will search for relevant information and provide answers with citations
3. You can ask for more details or request the original source document
4. For complex queries, try to be specific about what you're looking for

Example queries:
```
You: What's the deadline for the Q3 marketing campaign?
AI: According to the Marketing Calendar document, the Q3 campaign deadline is September 15th.

You: Can you summarize our refund policy?
AI: Based on the Customer Service Guidelines, our refund policy allows for...
```

## Best Practices

### Effective Knowledge Retrieval

1. **Be Specific**: Ask clear, focused questions to get the most relevant information
2. **Use Keywords**: Include important terms related to what you're looking for
3. **Refine Queries**: If you don't get what you need, try rephrasing your question

### Efficient Knowledge Capture

1. **Prepare Information**: Have key points ready before starting a documentation session
2. **Structure Matters**: Think about how to organize the information logically
3. **Review Carefully**: Always check generated documents for accuracy
4. **Update Regularly**: Return to documents to keep them current as information changes

## Common Use Cases

| Use Case | How to Approach It | Benefits |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Finding specific procedures | Ask "What is our procedure for X?" | Get immediate access to documented processes |
| Documenting team knowledge | Say "I want to document our approach to X" | Preserve expertise that might otherwise be lost |
| Answering client questions | Query "What's our policy on X for clients?" | Provide consistent, accurate responses |
| Training new team members | Ask for summaries of key processes | Accelerate onboarding with reliable information |

## Getting Help

If you need assistance:

1. **Ask the AI** for help with specific features
2. **Check this help center** for detailed guides
3. **Contact support** through the help desk for technical issues
4. **Provide feedback** to help improve the system

> [!NOTE]
