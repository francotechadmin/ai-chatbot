- **Start broad, then narrow** - Begin with general terms, then add specifics
- **Use synonyms** - Try different words for the same concept
- **Include context** - Add related terms to improve relevance
- **Check spelling** - Ensure search terms are spelled correctly

#### **Search Operators**
| Operator | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **AND** | All terms must appear | `marketing AND strategy` |
| **OR** | Either term can appear | `budget OR financial` |
| **NOT** | Exclude terms | `project NOT archived` |
| **"quotes"** | Exact phrase | `"quarterly report"` |
| **wildcard*** | Partial matches | `market*` finds marketing, marketplace |

## Understanding Semantic vs. Text Search

### Text Search (Keyword-Based)

Traditional search that looks for exact word matches:

#### **How Text Search Works**
- **Exact matching** - Finds documents containing specific words
- **Index-based** - Uses pre-built indexes for fast retrieval
- **Boolean logic** - Supports AND, OR, NOT operators
- **Pattern matching** - Finds exact phrases and word patterns

#### **When to Use Text Search**
- **Specific terms** - Looking for exact terminology or phrases
- **Technical content** - Finding specific codes, numbers, or identifiers
- **Precise matching** - When you know exact words used in documents
- **Quick filtering** - Rapidly narrow down large result sets

### Semantic Search (Meaning-Based)

Advanced search that understands meaning and context:

#### **How Semantic Search Works**
- **Meaning analysis** - Understands concepts, not just words
- **Context awareness** - Considers surrounding text and relationships
- **Synonym recognition** - Finds related terms and concepts
- **Intent understanding** - Interprets what you're really looking for

#### **When to Use Semantic Search**
- **Conceptual queries** - Looking for ideas or themes
- **Natural language** - Searching with questions or descriptions
- **Related content** - Finding documents on similar topics
- **Exploratory search** - Discovering relevant content you didn't know existed

### Choosing the Right Search Type

#### **Text Search is Better For:**
- Finding specific product codes or part numbers
- Locating exact quotes or legal language
- Searching for precise technical terms
- Finding documents with specific formatting or structure

#### **Semantic Search is Better For:**
- Understanding complex topics or concepts
- Finding related information across different documents
- Exploring new subject areas
- Getting comprehensive answers to questions

#### **Hybrid Approach**
- **Start with semantic** - Get broad understanding of available content
- **Refine with text** - Use specific terms to narrow results
- **Combine techniques** - Use both approaches for comprehensive coverage
- **Iterate searches** - Build on previous results to find more relevant content
