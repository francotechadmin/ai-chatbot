# Chat Features & Capabilities

Master all the powerful features available in your AI chatbot interface. This comprehensive guide covers everything from basic text conversations to advanced multi-modal interactions.

## Text Input and Conversation Flow

### Basic Text Interaction

The foundation of your AI experience is natural text conversation:

#### **Composing Messages**
- **Type naturally** - Use everyday language, no special syntax required
- **Multiple lines** - Use Shift+Enter for line breaks within a single message
- **Message length** - No strict limits, but focused messages work best
- **Formatting** - Basic markdown is supported for emphasis and structure

#### **Conversation Context**
The AI maintains context throughout your conversation:
- **Remembers previous messages** in the current chat session
- **References earlier topics** naturally
- **Builds on established context** for follow-up questions
- **Maintains conversation thread** until you start a new chat

> [!TIP]
> You can refer to "the document we discussed earlier" or "that code you showed me" and the AI will understand the context.

### Message Types and Patterns

#### **Question Types**
- **Direct questions** - "What is machine learning?"
- **Comparative questions** - "What's the difference between X and Y?"
